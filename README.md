[10-10-2024 20:27:54] This is the very start of a project "Hospital Management System" using Django, MySQL, HTML, CSS and Python. 
I have recently started doing this; although i have learn't many things in Django but i am late to implement all of those due to 
less time got to spend on it. 
Kindly consider this for the evaluation for now. 
But i am also attaching a very finised layout(in .docx file) of what my project will be doing and i have planned to design to look like
It had been a difficult task for me to alone handle this project as my partner had less contribution to this, so 
i was the only person to design the layout, database schema, the ppt and django application (whatever created till now).

Till now the registeration page for patient/doctor/receptionist had completely done meaning connectivity wise it's connected to database and the frontend.
I am likely to change the frontend to mimic the new and modern sites.
